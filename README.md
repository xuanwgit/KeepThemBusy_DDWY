## Team Project for User Interfases course JAC

## Team Case Project 1
Throughout the Team Case Projects in this course you will continue to work on a website on a subject 
chosen by your team, including adding JavaScript functionalities to your previous Web Design project. 
Working in a team of 3â€“4 people, discuss and agree on a topic for your website. This may be a topic 
related to your major, another area of study, your college or university, or a shared interest. Work 
together to plan a website that has, at a minimum, the number of pages equals to twice the number of 
group members, and to create a common layout and navigation system. Note that you will add pages to 
your site in later classes, so ensure that your navigation system can support additional content. Decide as 
a group who will create which page and create the pages individually. When you have finished creating 
the individual pages, ensure they pass validation, and then work together to assemble the resulting 
website, identifying and fixing any issues as a group.

## Team Case Project 2
Choose one of the web pages from your team website to enhance the user interface with at least two 
functions. Common uses of functions include performing actions based on user input (validation, 
personalization of the web page) and performing calculations. Divide your team into subgroups equal to 
the number of functions your page will include. After each subgroup has created its function, come back 
together as a full group, and incorporate the functions in the web page. Test the user interfaces to verify 
the page works as planned, doing any troubleshooting, and making any edits to the functions as a full 
team.

## Team Case Project 3
Choose one of the web pages from your team web site to enhance with code that uses an array and a loop. 
Arrays are often used to store a set of related data, either provided by the developer or added by a user.
Loops are often used in combination with arrays to perform a common action on each element in an 
array. Plan the structure of the code as a team, then divide into two groups. One group should create the 
code for the array, and the other the code for the loop. After each group has completed its work, come 
back together as a full group, and incorporate the code in the group web page. Test the code to verify the 
page works as planned, doing any troubleshooting, and making any edit to the user interfaces as a full 
team.
